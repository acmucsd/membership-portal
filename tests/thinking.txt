What do we want out of seeds?

Mimic real interactions for testing purposes, e.g. attendances and activities

Create users (different roles)
Create events (different hosts, committees, some request staff others donâ€™t)
Have those users check in as staff and members
Make them order stuff
Admin grant bonuses to users for missing event + bit/byte program participant

We define some small system from which anything is testable at reasonable scale, and all events are created relative to the current time, so it can easily be reset every hour for testing

2 admin
3 staff
4 members

Already happened
1. Some admins create their accounts
2. Some staff create their accounts
3. Admins create some past, ongoing, and future events
4. Members create their accounts
5. some members and staff checked into past events
6. Admin grant bonus points for some user who forgot to check in
7. admin grant bonus points for some user who did some bit-byte thing
8. Some members and staff checked into ongoing events
9. Some members and staff order merch

Can still happen in the process of testing:
1. users can still check in as members and/or staff
2. Users can still place orders (i.e. have enough credits)
